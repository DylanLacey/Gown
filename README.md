# Gown

Sauce Connect's verbose logs are big and hard to read.  Replace all those puffy KGP lines, bulky CMDs and tightly cinched MAINs with a breezy gown!

## Installation

Gown is intended to be installed as a standalone tool:

    $ gem install gown

But, you can use it in the normal way by adding it to your Gemfile.  If you want to do this, you should probably already know how ;)

## Usage

### Default Operation
Gown takes one required argument, `file_to_strip`:

`   $ gown original_filename.log`

By default, it will write the stripped log to `original_filename.log.stripped`.  To write to a desired file, pass a second argument:

`   $ gown original_filename.log new_filename.log`

### Custom Filtering
The patterns for filtering are defined in `gown/lib/gown/patterns.rb`.  They're added to the pattern collection in `gown/gown.rb`.

The ability to edit these is coming.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
